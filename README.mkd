### Quartz Composer Plugin: String From Xpath

Short-cut for xml import / structure key member navigation.

Currently only pulls out one xpath expression.

Only tried building and running on 10.6 intel, but should work elsewhere.

To build:

* open in Xcode (3.2)
* use target => build & copy => <right-click> => build & copy & start.
